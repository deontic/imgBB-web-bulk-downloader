 _download imageBB images in bulk_
 

 
The last and quickest to use of the 3 imgBB utilities I've created to bulk download images from the site.

Simply :

* visit the imgBB upload page
* click the button to copy the urls
* paste them in the textbox on https://deontic.github.io/imgBB-web-bulk-downloader
* press the download button

Hit download and it will download the urls. In case your browser warns you of the site downloading multiple urls, allow it by clicking the button in the popup that appears.
